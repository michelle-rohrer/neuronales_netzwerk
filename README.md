# Neuronales Netzwerk

This is only the code and not our complete submission.

### Project

The objective of this assignment was to gain a comprehensive understanding of numerical approximation methods in higher dimensions, with a specific focus on gradient descent and its practical application. The task required the development of a neural network from scratch, using only basic Python libraries and minimal external tools. The MNIST dataset served as the primary data source for training and testing the network.

The process involved several steps:

Data Exploration: Loading and analyzing the MNIST dataset to understand its structure and distribution using basic visualization techniques.
Implementation: Designing a custom neural network, including linear layers with forward-pass, backward-pass, and parameter update functionalities implemented manually with NumPy.
Evaluation and Training: Training the network to identify specific digits and experimenting with different configurations, such as learning rates and hidden layer sizes, to optimize performance.
Advanced Network Design: Extending the network to include multiple hidden layers and outputs for classifying all digits in the dataset.
Documentation and Reflection: Maintaining a detailed learning journal to document progress, challenges, and insights, along with transparent usage and reflection on AI tools like ChatGPT for assistance.
